## 1. TeX

TeX is a typesetting system.  It's quite helpful for scientific document as it makes the process of writing equations and compiling your bibliography.

To download the TeX software:
* Unix/Linux: [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
* Mac: [MacTex](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) plus [TeXShop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/) frontend
* Windows: [proTeXt](https://www.tug.org/protext/) (comes with [TeXStudio](\href{)http://texstudio.sourceforge.net) frontend)

In addition, I like to use Excel to format tables (and for easy viewing) and thus often use the Excel plug-in [Excel2Latex](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/excel2latex?lang=en).

To get started using TeX, you might look at the [LaTeX tutorial PDF chapter](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2017/blob/master/Tutorials/LaTeX/LaTeX_tutorial.pdf) in the [`/Tutorials/LaTeX/`](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2017/tree/master/Tutorials/LaTeX) directory of the Open Source Macro Bootcamp.  This provides a great reference for installing and running LaTeX. Also included in that directory is a template [`LaTeX_probset_template.tex`](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2017/blob/master/Tutorials/LaTeX/LaTeX_probset_template.tex) as well as the PDf file [(`LaTeX_probset_template.pdf`)](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2017/blob/master/Tutorials/LaTeX/LaTeX_probset_template.pdf) generated by compiling that `.tex` file.  You won't structure a document exactly like this template, but it will help you get started.


## 2. Text editor suggestions

In our recommended Python development workflow, you will write Python scripts and modules (`*.py` files) in a text editor. Then you will run those scripts from your terminal. You will want a capable text editor for developing your code. Many capable text editors exist, but I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is free and will be included with your installation of Anaconda.  This is a very capable text editor and will include syntax highlighting for Python and and built in Git controls.  In addition to the basics, you may want to use a more advanced linter for Python.  This will help you correct syntax errors on the fly and provide helpful information as you declare objects and call functions.  [This link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting) provides step-by-step instructions on using more advanced linting in VS Code.

Some extensions that I recommend installing into your VS Code:
* cornflakes-linter
* Git Extension Pack
* GitLens
* Jupyter
* LaTeX language support
* LaTeX preview
* LaTeX Workshop
* Markdown All in One
* Pylance
* Stata Enhanced


## 3. Working in the Command Line

It's helpful to know your way around the Unix/DOS command line.  This is the way I recommend interacting with Git (discussed below) and is also how I typically run Python scripts.  It's also the only way you can typically interact with remote servers on which you might store data or run software (such as the [Research Cyber Infrastructure](http://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/division_of_information_technology/rci/) clusters on campus).

Some of the most common commands you'll use are summarized in the table below.

| Command                                              | Unix                                                                                                         | DOS                                                                                                                              |

## 4. Git and GitHub tutorial

I have included a tutorial on using [Git and GitHub.com](https://github.com/jdebacker/CompEcon_Fall21/blob/main/Productivity/git_tutorial.pdf). Git is a powerful version control software that comes natively installed on many machines and is widely used. GitHub.com is the most widely used online platform for hosting open source projects and integrating with Git software. Git has a significant learning curve, but it is essential for large collaborations that involve software development.

| Functionality                                               | Git Command                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|

## 5. Instructions for installing the Anaconda distribution of Python

We will be using the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and many of its powerful libraries for writing the code to solve and estimate economic models. Using an open source language, such as Python, has the advantage of being free and accessible for anyone who wishes to contribute to this project. Being open source also allows Python users to go into the source code of any function to modify it to suit one's needs.

I recommend that you download the Anaconda distribution of Python provided by [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org). I recommend the most recent stable version of Python, which is currently Python 3.6. This can be done from the [Anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads) for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux machines. The code we will be writing uses common Python libraries such as `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `pickle`, `os`, `matplotlib`, and `time`.


## 6. PEP 8, docstring commenting, and module structure

Computer code executes some set of commands in an organized way. In every case, there are often many ways to execute a set of instructions--some ways more efficient than others. However, code has at least three functions.

1. Efficiently execute the task at hand.
2. Be accessible and usable to other programmers.
3. Be scalable and integrable with other projects and procedures.

Bill Gates is credited with the following plea for efficiency and parsimony in code writing.

> "Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight."

Strong support for points (2) and (3) is Eagleson's Law.

> "Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else."

Because of the latter two characteristics, Python code has developed some conventions and best practices, some of which have been institutionalized in the [PEP 8--Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) ("PEP" stands for Python Enhancement Proposals). Key examples PEP 8 Python coding conventions are the following.

* Indents should be 4 spaces (not tab)
* Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters long blocks of text being limited to 72 characters
* Use a space after a comma
* Use a space before and after arithmetic operators

In the text editors Atom and Sublime Text 3 you can install Linter packages that highlight areas of your code that break PEP 8 rules and tell you what the violation is.


## 7. Jupyter Notebooks

[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) are files that end with the `*.ipynb` suffix. These notebooks are opened in a browser environment and are an open source web application that combines instructional text with live executable and modifyable code for many different programming platforms (e.g., Python, R, Julia). Jupyter notebooks are an ideal tool for teaching programming as they provide the code for a user to execute and they also provide the context and explanation for the code. We have provided a number of Jupyter notebooks in the [Tutorials](https://github.com/OpenRG/WB-India-2019/tree/master/Tutorials) folder of this repository.

These notebooks used to be Python-specific, and were therefore called iPython notebooks (hence the `*.ipynb` suffix). But Jupyter notebooks now support many programming languages, although the name still pays homage to Python with the vestigal "py" in "Jupyter". The notebooks execute code from the kernel of the specific programming language on your local machine.

Jupyter notebooks capability will be automatically installed with your download of the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) of Python. If you did not download the Anaconda distribution of Python, you can download Jupyter notebooks separately by following the instructions on the Jupyter [install page](http://jupyter.org/install).


### 7.1. Opening a Jupyter notebook

Once Jupyter is installed--whether through Anaconda or through the Jupyter website--you can open a Jupyter notebook by the following steps.

1. Navigate in your terminal to the folder in which the Jupyter notebook files reside. In the case of the Jupyter notebook tutorials in this repository, you would navigate to the `~/WB-India-2019/Tutorials/` directory.
2. Type `jupyter notebook` at the terminal prompt.
3. A Jupyter notebook session will open in your browser, showing the available `*.ipynb` files in that directory.
  *  In some cases, you might receive a prompt in the terminal telling you to paste a url into your browser.
4. Double click on the Jupyter notebook you would like to open.

It is worth noting that you can also simply navigate to the URL of the Jupyter notebook file in the GitHub repository on the web (e.g., [https://github.com/OpenRG/WB-India-2019/blob/master/Tutorials/PythonReadIn.ipynb](https://github.com/OpenRG/WB-India-2019/blob/master/Tutorials/PythonReadIn.ipynb)). You can read the Jupyter notebook on GitHub.com, but you cannot execute any of the cells. You can only execute the cells in the Jupyter notebook when you follow the steps above and open the file from a Jupyter notebook session in your browser.


### 7.2. Using an open Jupyter notebook

Once you have opened a Jupyter notebook, you will find the notebook has two main types of cells: Markdown cells and Code cells. Markdown cells have formatted Jupyter notebook markdown text, and serve primarily to present context for the coding cells. A reference for the markdown options in Jupyter notebooks is found in the [Jupyter markdown documentation page](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html).

You can edit a Markdown cell in a Jupyter notebook by double clicking on the cell and then making your changes. Make sure the cell-type box in the middle of the top menu bar is set to `Markdown`. To implement your changes in the Markdown cell, type `Shift-Enter`.

A Code cell will have a `In [ ]:` immediately to the left of the cell for input. The code in that cell can be executed by typing `Shift-Enter`. For a Code cell, the  cell-type box in the middle of the top menu bar says `Code`.


### 7.3. Closing a Jupyter notebook

When you are done with a Jupyter notebook, you first save any changes that you want to remain with the notebook. Then you close the browser windows associated with that Jupyter notebook session. You should then close the local server instance that was opened to run the Jupyter notebook in your terminal window. On a Mac or Windows, this is done by going to your terminal window and typing `Cmd-C` or `Ctrl-C` and then selecting `y` for yes and hitting `Enter`.
