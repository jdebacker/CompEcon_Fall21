@article{phili,
	abstract = { There has been a shift in many developing countries, particularly Small Island Developing States (SIDS), towards tourism as the centrepiece of their development strategy. This occurs in the context of narrowing developmental options occasioned by the end of preferential access to metropolitan markets for agriculture and the attendant decline of the primary sector. This article draws on evidence from two case studies from the microstates of the Eastern Caribbean -- St Lucia and St Vincent -- and discusses the implications of their respective approaches and the ambiguous nature of tourism as a development strategy. },

	abstract = {The evolution of tourism is characterized worldwide by a growth trend as a result of the influence of economic, social, demographic and political factors. The core idea of the present paper is to conduct a comparative analysis in order to highlight the importance of travel and tourism industry as being one of the largest sectors, supporting around 292 million jobs worldwide, generating around 10% of the global GDP, accounting for around 7% of all exports and about 30% of the services' exports worldwide. Thus, the aim of the paper is to assess the size and dynamics of the travel and tourism industry compared to other industries. These sectors of activity are regarded as having a similar presence worldwide. The current paper is intended to be a radiography of the impact of this industry upon the economic growth worldwide, so that it is eventually perceived as an important economic engine worldwide.},
